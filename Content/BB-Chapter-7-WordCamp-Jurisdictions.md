# Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress 
## Chapter 7 — WordCamp Jurisdictions
### Local is relative

The first WordCamp Europe took place in Leiden, the Netherlands, in 2013, though it wasn’t until Vienna in 2016 that WordCamp Europe truly became a landmark event. Attendance soared, with over 1,950 people attending, coming from 68 different countries. There were also 1,402 Live Streaming tickets representing 82 countries. Contributor Day drew 440 Contributors. This was the largest WordCamp ever at the time.


There were 20 organizers, 69 speakers, and 160 volunteers. WordCamp Europe also featured a Wapuu coloring book.


WordCamp Europe was a continent-wide event and has continued through the years. WordCamp U.S. was the other flagship WordCamp, inaugurated in 2015 in San Francisco. Prior to this time, there were a number of other nationwide WordCamps, including WordCamp Netherlands, which began in 2009. WordCamps UK, Switzerland, Denmark, Croatia, and Israel were other examples.


In 2017, however, the decision was made not to allow WordCamp Netherlands but to insist on a city-based WordCamp. “We have worked hard in the past eight years to move the WordCamp program away from country-named events and toward city-named events for a number of reasons that focus on the health and longevity of the community as a whole,” Josepha wrote. “After observing hundreds of WordCamps and WordPress Meetup events over the years, we have seen that hosting city-named events helps to prevent entrenched leadership, makes space for new volunteers and participants, and gives clarity to how the program functions.”


She went on to point out that the growing focus on big, flashy events was setting a bar that made it hard for the small, local events to feel successful, even though the original intent for WordCamps was to support local WordPress communities.

### A controversial ruling
The Netherlands organizers didn’t just disagree. In fact, the decision was met with fierce opposition. 


“The NL are a small country, the land area is only a tenth of California and a third of the inhabitants. Within 2 hours you can reach almost any place in the country,” wrote one. “Perhaps this makes it eventually clear why we should not set the same standards here as in the U.S. or France.”


WordCamp Netherlands was held in different cities around the nation, and members of the smaller WordPress communities looked forward to seeing one another at this annual event.


Other regional WordCamps, as the community began to call the national and continental camps, had disagreed with the rulings as well, but they had complied with a fairly good grace. The Netherlands, perhaps particularly because they had hosted the first WordCamp Europe, were openly upset about the ruling.


They announced that they might go rogue and hold their WordCamp under some other name without the auspices of the central committee. 


Andrea Middleton had previously written, “One goal for the WordPress Community program is to have a WordPress meetup and annual WordCamp in as many cities as possible in the world. So while regional or national events have a purpose, they should never be a replacement for our focus on supporting the growth and health of local communities.”


She went on, “Another goal in the WordPress Community program (which dovetails nicely with our goal of having a community in as many cities in the world as possible) is to make WordPress community accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their financial status or other factors that might limit travel. Having several WordCamps in a certain country every year makes WordCamp more available to more people, even if those folks are not able to travel.”


In the ensuing discussion, organizers from countries that had been required to switch from regional to city-based WordCamps brought up concerns:
Small camps were as much effort to organize as large camps, thus making their “bang for the buck” lower. 
City-level WordCamps would cannibalize organizers, speakers, and attendees from monthly meetup groups.
Regional WordCamps allow people from small communities to meet new people in ways that city-wide WordCamps don’t.
Organizers in smaller countries wanted to pool their resources to produce stronger events than they could within their own cities.
Instead of “regional” and “city,” which equates a city the size of New York with a city the size of Zurich, determining the jurisdictions of WordCamps should rely on population size and geographic distances.
Yvette Sonneveld, a contributor on the Marketing team and team lead for the community team at Yoast, said the objections were practical, not emotional. “If you have only ever worked and lived in the U.S.,” she points out, “it can be hard to imagine how small some of the countries in Europe can be.” Cities just one hour’s drive apart found themselves competing for attendees and sponsors.


Arguments on the other side were few and far between, though [Kåre Mulvad Steffensen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dejliglama/) of Denmark said, “I think it’s clear that the ecosystem is based on strong hyperlocal communities, that feed into a larger community, on a regional or countrywide basis.” However, he also added, “The geographical rules have no real value. We should trust WordPress community members to be able to self-organize in groups that does [sic] not challenge the hyperlocal activities.”


Randy Hicks, lead organizer for WordCamp Nashville, spoke in favor of regional camps but worried that “they are going to be a huge vacuum sucking up resources.”

### Back to the Netherlands
The organizing committee reported on their experience of the change in 2018. 


They found that people in the Netherlands had to choose among the various city-based WordCamps and that this pressured organizers to make each city-based WordCamp different from the others, with different target markets and different speakers. They felt that the cities were competing with one another rather than serving their local audience. 


This experience also affected finances at the city-based WordCamps, which had difficulty finding sponsors and sometimes ran at a deficit. 


Discussions on the experience at that point focused on the vision of small, informal local WordCamps vs. larger, fancier regional WordCamps. 


While the Dutch participants were steadfast in their claims that they are just too small a country for city-based camps to make sense, Automattician Hugh Lashbrooke from New Zealand emphasized the way that city-based WordCamps could serve as incubators for leaders and speakers.


WordCamp, he pointed out, was developed with a strong emphasis on local connections. Regional WordCamps prevented those close connections. “As soon as you get a WordCamp of that size, you can’t really connect with everyone.”


The situation with the Netherlands also highlighted other concerns with regional WordCamps. The same organizing team planned WordCamp Netherlands year after year, leading to entrenched leadership. Not only is this contrary to the goal of open source projects like WordPress but there have been other individuals in the Netherlands who reached out to the WordCamp core team saying that they didn’t feel they had the opportunity to join in organizing WordCamp.


WordCamps intended to increase diversity and encourage new speakers and new organizers, which is less likely when the same group of people are in charge over the years. 


Yvette reported that the WordPress community in the Netherlands gave the city-based WordCamps a fair try before deciding against them. 


One more problem Hugh mentioned was that people will attend a flagship event like WordCamp Europe or WordCamp US and think, “I want my WordCamp to look like that!” The desire for a flashy event at a premium venue with fancy fittings and famous speakers is understandable, but it’s not the point of local WordCamps.


Matt remarked that much of the debate was based on nomenclature. He could envision smaller or more rural states in the U.S. holding statewide WordCamps that just happened to be named for the city which was able to host the event. In a large and highly populated country like India, on the other hand, he could see WordCamps being divided according to participants’ native languages. Again, naming the WordCamp for the city in which it took place would not need to limit participants’ creativity. 


Rules on regional WordCamps were relaxed in 2020, and online regional events occurred during the pandemic. As the pandemic calmed and in-person events emerged again, several smaller European nations returned to the national WordCamp model.
