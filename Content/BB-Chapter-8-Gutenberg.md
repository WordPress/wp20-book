# Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress

### WordPress makes the case for Gutenberg


Gutenberg, now known as the Block Editor, was a major change for WordPress. On the surface, Gutenberg was just a new text editor, but beneath the surface, there is more to the story. 


For some time, as people began to access the web with their phones and other devices, web content producers talked about the need to change the way content was presented. Instead of thinking of a page and trying to make it work on a smaller screen, it made sense to think of content as blocks that could be arranged in different ways to work on different kinds of screens and devices and for different purposes. 


The new Gutenberg editor did exactly that. 


Just as some users were frustrated when the Customizer added menus, bringing content into a design tool, some users were alarmed when Gutenberg brought layout and thus design into the text editor. 


Eventually, the long-term goal was to make it possible to do full site editing in a single interface. That goal is on the horizon. 


When Gutenberg first made its appearance in 2017, it was a new way to write posts and pages. Matt had introduced the idea of a visual editor in his State of the Word address in 2016, and the Gutenberg plugin was soon the result. 


“We called it Gutenberg for a reason,” [he wrote](https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/) in August 2017. “Movable type was about books, but it wasn’t just about books. Ideas spread. Literacy spiked. The elite monopoly on education started to crack…WordPress has always been about websites, but it’s not just about websites. It’s about freedom, about possibility, and about carving out your own livelihood.”


Gutenberg, he said, was about democratizing publishing “and democratizing work — for everyone, regardless of language, ability, or economic wherewithal.”


Gutenberg did that by providing a standard, portable publishing method without proprietary page builders or premium themes that locked users into a walled garden approach to building pages and creating posts. It was intended to open new pathways for plugins, to allow photographers, artists, poets, and musicians to present their creative works in creative ways, and to allow everyone to make their sites look and behave as they had envisioned they would.


Gutenberg would create a truly WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor and allow greater control over the visual presentation of the website without a need to write code. At the same time, it breaks the work of managing a site into its smallest parts – blocks – and applies that to the whole site.

## Resistance
Nothing with that scope can be expected to come about without resistance, and there was plenty of resistance to Gutenberg. As [Michael Philips](https://www.greengeeks.com/tutorials/classic-editor-wordpress/) wrote, “WordPress unveiled the new post and page editor named Gutenberg and the world rejoiced. And by ‘rejoiced,’ I mean they almost universally heaped condemnation and hatred upon the defenseless new editor.“


Many users saw Gutenberg as a market-driven reaction to Wix and Squarespace. Some of those who knew and loved WordPress in its classic form resented having their experience disrupted for the sake — they were convinced — of competing for new users. And at first, it appeared to make few allies.


Writers found it slow. Each paragraph had to be written in a new block and all the pointing and clicking interfered with the flow of ideas. For writers who thought of the words as their domain and relied on designers to make the pages look good, Gutenberg provided no clear benefits to make up for the obstacles. 


Designers felt they had less control than they were used to. At the same time, they worried that Gutenberg would make WordPress into a fully DIY platform and put them out of a job. 


Developers worried that all their products would have to be rebuilt to fit in with Gutenberg. Sites built with widgets and custom post types would become obsolete, they feared, and metaboxes would no longer be available.


Site owners found that the WordPress skills they had learned no longer allowed them to accomplish the tasks they needed to control. Staff who had been able to make updates reliably might not be able to do so anymore, and plugins they had paid to have installed and configured suddenly had compatibility issues. 


And the truth remained: most people who were not designers couldn’t actually build a beautiful page with Gutenberg. It had a steep learning curve that required considerable skill and rewarded those who tenaciously exercised their creative abilities.

## Disruption

When Gutenberg became the default editor, core contributors created the Classic Editor plugin as a transitional onramp to the use of the block editor. Initially, the plan was to sunset that plugin on December 31, 2021, having given everyone enough time to get used to the new editor. That didn’t happen. In fact, the block editor now offers an experience like the classic editor as one of its blocks.


In 2017, however, at WordCamp Europe in Paris, Matt asked the audience to be cheerleaders for Gutenberg, to go home and encourage its use in their meetups and local WordCamps.


The community seemed to be warming up to it. Sessions advocating for Gutenberg became a fixture at WordCamps. A typical cheerleading session was “The Future of WordPress is Gutenberg” at WordCamp US 2018.


“WordPress has been around for 15 years. Over 30% of sites use it, and that figure continues to climb. We’re here for the long term, so we need to plan for the long term: Gutenberg has been built as the base for the next 15 years of WordPress,” the description read. “What you see in the block editor is the first practical application of what’s going on underneath: a modern design process, an extensible technical architecture, and a forward-thinking foundation to build our future upon.”


Other Gutenberg-related sessions that year included “Gutenberg, GraphQL and Government: Building Blocks,” “Block Development,” a session on AMP support in Gutenberg blocks, Gutenberg for front-end developers, and use case examples.


“Since Gutenberg is still a work in progress, this presentation is not intended as the absolute truth,” one session description confessed. 


There was excitement, and there was continued resistance. Josepha said, “I spent six months going to the angriest communities and listening.” Some discussions focused on the feeling that WordPress users — or particular segments of the user community — weren’t being listened to. Others suggested that people who refused to use Gutenberg were hidebound and not open to change, never an easy thing to hear. Still, others didn’t center on Gutenberg as an editor at all but complained that the process of change had not seemed collaborative enough. 


“How can you bring something that disruptive without being that disruptive?” asked Matias Ventura, the lead architect of Gutenberg. In a blog post, he compared Gutenberg to the ship of Theseus, which had to be completely rebuilt while it was still sailing. “How can such a vision happen without dismantling, rebuilding, fragmenting, or breaking the WordPress ship that for over a decade has been carrying the thoughts, joys, and livelihoods of millions of people and more than a quarter of the web?” That was the Gutenberg experience.

## Continuous improvement
Meanwhile, Gutenberg was improved and updated very regularly. Some users had problems and gave up Gutenberg, not realizing that the problems they faced were being solved.


For example, the earliest iterations of the Gutenberg plugin were designed so that a page built with the block editor would lose its formatting if it was later edited with the classic editor. Today few users remember that — but it was the kind of experience that caused people to give up on Gutenberg early. 


Many plugins didn’t work on pages built in Gutenberg, but plugin designers hurried to update their offerings, so most problems were also solved fairly quickly. 


Tools were in different places than users expected, sometimes in multiple places, and sometimes they were hard to find. They moved many times during the process of improving Gutenberg. This ended up being one of the most common pain points. But again, users who stuck with Gutenberg through the growing pains found that in the long run, their concerns were addressed. 


“There was not immediate agreement on what constituted a breaking change,” Josepha observed. “Breaking workflow can be as much of a problem as breaking a web page.”


The core team continued to test and improve. Users continued to be divided. The Gutenberg plugin continues to receive reviews, even though the block editor is now the default editor. The plugin is updated every two weeks, and users of the plugin can try out the new features ahead of the pack. Their feedback, says Tammie Lister, is important to what makes it into core. Roughly 10% of updates make it into a major release.


However, especially for designers who are not developers, full site editing with the block editor allows creative page building without a need to rely on code. Drag-and-drop and point-and-click functionality let people who have grown skilled with the block editor do things that just a few years ago would have required a developer to create.


By the end of 2018, WordPress powered 32.7% of the world’s websites, and in 2019 that number grew to 35.4%. The new patterns directory and a constantly-growing collection of blocks and block-friendly plugins have opened new vistas for site builders and made WordPress a welcoming option for a new cadre of users.
