# wp20-book

Welcome to the online repository for the book, *Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress*, on the history and development of WordPress. This book focuses on the 2nd decade of the WordPress project, especially the Gutenberg project, the global pandemic, and a look at the hoped-for future of our project.

## Table of Contents

## Feedback

The following feedback is particularly valuable:
- *Factual errors*: notes about factual errors are welcome. All suggestions for changes should be evidenced with links that back up any claims. Any facts that cannot be corroborated will not be included.
- *Clarity*:  any paragraphs or sections that you feel are not clear. This would be of particular help in sections that are technical in nature.
- *Omissions*: anything that you feel has been omitted or not sufficiently covered. Note that this is a lengthy piece of writing and many issues have to be condensed to ensure that it is a manageable and interesting read. Suggestions about omissions should be accompanied with information about why it should be included, and backed up with evidence as to their importance.
- *Images*: if you have any images that you feel would complement the text, we'd love to have them.

All feedback should be opened as [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/wp20-book/issues) in the tracker.

## Translations

When the book is ready for production and no more changes are expected, we would welcome translations. To translate the book, please create a sub-directory of the project, giving it the correct [ISO639](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code (for example, pt for Portuguese), and submit a pull request.
